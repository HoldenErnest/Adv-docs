# Player

A player is just an interface that controls where the outputs of a character go:
 - Outputs from the Character are sent to the [PlayerUI](./PlayerUI.md)

!! There will only ever be 1 player. If multiplayer, it will likely show up as a normal Character with a NetworkController. !!

## Uses
 - [Character](./Character.md)
