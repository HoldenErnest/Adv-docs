# SaveAll

Saves the gamestate. Game can only be saved from specific save locations (like a stone in the middle of the city) so that I know exactly how things should be saved

!! important !! I dont really want to save things in real time (They should have reign to choose save points?)

## Using
 - SaveQuests
 - [SaveCharacters](./SaveCharacters.md)
 - Save Hotbar (TODO: other player related things?)
