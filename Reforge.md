# Reforge

The basic idea is when you reforge an [Equipment](./Equipment.md), adds a `reforge level` each time.


## Uses
 - [Equipment](./Equipment.md)

### Reforge levels
 - Every reforge level increases the base stats on this Equipment:
    - Armor Value (physical)
    - resist values
    - damage value

 - Every X reforge levels, increase the non basic stats on this Equipment by 1.
    - speed, con, evasion, int, str, ETC..
