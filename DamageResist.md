The damage resistence calculation

## Resist Types:
 - resist against all [Skill Types](./SkillTypes.md) Except healing

### Core contributors
 - Skill Types Equipped. (more skills of the same type increase your resist against it)
 - Equipment
    - equips have hard coded resistence values built into some of them. These increase with [Reforges](./Reforge.md)
